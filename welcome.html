<h2>Introduction to VR</h2>
    <p> virtual Reality (VR) is a simulated experience that can be similar to or completely different from the real world. 
    It involves a user interacting with a computer-generated environment through various devices such as headsets, gloves, and body suits.<br>     
    Virtual Reality – Introduction <br>
    Imagination is to Technology as Fuel is to Fire. Imagination and purpose together drive technology. It is due to these that technology today is evolving at an exponential rate. 
    Virtual Reality on one hand places the viewer inside a moment or a place, made possible by visual and sound technology that maneuvers the brain into believing it is somewhere else. 
    It is an experience of a world that does not exist. Sounds cool, right?! <br>

Virtual Reality tricks one’s mind using computers that allow one to experience and more interestingly, interact with a 3D world. 
  This is made possible by putting on a head-mounted display that sends a form of input tracking.,<br>
  The display is split between the eyes and thus creates a stereoscopic 3D effect with stereo sound to give you a graphic experience. 
  The technology feeds in the images of the objects taken at slightly different angles which creates an impression of depth and solidity. 
  The LCD or OLED panels inside are refracted by lenses completely fill the field of vision with what is to be displayed and experienced. <br>

  Together with the technology and the input tracking, it creates an immersive and exciting believable world that the computer generates. What we know today as VR, has been existing for decades now. <br>
  
  Taking you back to when 360° paintings took the world by surprise, giving a virtual element. <br>
  VR merely is ‘The Wise Guy’ of the digital world. It creates a world that neither functions according to you, nor does it respond to your actions. It gives you a first-hand experience with even the after-effects of an event along with the ability to interacta and interrelate with the world created. 
  This technology holds vast potential insights into the workings of the Human Brain. According to researchers and medical specialists, VRs have the ability to diagnose medical conditions from social anxiety to chronic pain.
  Though the use of VR to tweak the brain is still at a budding stage. <br>

  While most people were too engrossed in its advancements and leap in gaming and exploring the industry, many are unaware of its achievements in the health sector. VRs have been successfully treating post-traumatic stress disorder since the 1990s, the new programs thus address a much broader range of conditions. 
  The VR content exposes the patients to a virtual, safe, and controlled environment where they can explore and eventually learn that the threats they are worried about can be tackled patiently with time, thinking, and analyzing. 
    VR displays are available in various forms. Ranging from the ones that already contain the display, splitting the feed for each eye using a cable to transfer the feed to the console,tomore affordable ones which depend upon the VR mode and applications on Smartphones. <br>
    
    The HTC Vive, the Oculus Rift, and Sony PlayStation VR are a few of the head mounts that use this setup. One can create one’s own Virtual Reality Box at home, along with a smartphone compatible with the VR mode. <br>
    Irrespective of the use, Virtual Reality produces a set of data that can be used to develop models, communication, training methods, and interaction. In simple words, the possibilities are endless. <br>

            <h2>History of VR</h2>
            <p>The concept of VR has been around since the 1950s, but it wasn't until the late 20th century that technology caught up with imagination, leading to the development of VR as we know it today. Milestones include the creation of the first head-mounted display (HMD) and the rise of consumer VR platforms.<br>
            In 1935 Stanley Weinbaum released Pygmalion’s Spectacles – a science fiction story. The story’s main character wears a pair of goggles which transports him to a fictional world which stimulates his senses aptly and features holographic recordings. Some consider it to be the origin of the virtual reality (VR) concept as this story was a good prediction of the aims and achievements of the future.<br>

            However the first VR technical developments were in the 1830s, so this is where our timeline starts:<br>

            <h3>1838</h3><br>
            Sir Charles Wheatstone was the first to describe stereopsis in 1838 and was awarded the Royal Medal of the Royal Society in 1840 for his explanation of binocular vision, a research which led him to construct the stereoscope.<br>
            
            The research demonstrated that the brain combines two photographs (one eye viewing each) of the same object taken from different points to make the image appear to have a sense of depth and immersion (3-dimensional).<br>
            
            This technology enabled Wheatstone to create the earliest type of stereoscope. It used a pair of mirrors at 45 degree angles to the user’s eyes, each reflecting a picture located off to the side.<br>

            <h3>1935</h3><br>
            In 1935 American science fiction writer Stanley Weinbaum presented a fictional model for VR in his short story Pygmalion’s Spectacles. In the story, the main character meets a professor who invented a pair of goggles which enabled “a movie that gives one sight and sound […] taste, smell, and touch. […] You are in the story, you speak to the shadows (characters) and they reply […] the story is all about you, and you are in it.”<br>

            <h3>1956</h3><br>
            Cinematographer Morton Heilig created Sensorama, the first VR machine (patented in 1962). It was a large booth that could fit up to four people at a time. It combined multiple technologies to stimulate all of the senses: there was a combined full colour 3D video, audio, vibrations, smell and atmospheric effects, such as wind.<br>
            
            This was done using scent producers, a vibrating chair, stereo speakers and a stereoscopic 3D screen. Heilig thought that the Sensorama was the “cinema of the future” and he wanted to fully immerse people in their films. Six short films were developed for it.

            <h3>1960</h3><br>
            Heilig also patented the Telesphere Mask which was the first head-mounted display (HMD). This provided stereoscopic 3D images with wide vision and stereo sound. There was no motion tracking in the headset at this point.<br>
            
            <h3>1961</h3><br>
            Until Headsight was created by Comeau and Bryan, two Philco Corporation engineers. Headsight was the first motion tracking HMD. It had built-in video screens for each eye and a head-tracking system.<br>
            
            However, this wasn’t used for virtual reality; it was developed for the military to allow them to remotely look at hazardous situations. A remote camera imitated the head movements so the user could look around the setting.<br>
            
            <h3>1965</h3><br>
            Ivan Sutherland, a computer scientist, presented his vision of the Ultimate Display. The concept was of a virtual world viewed through an HMD which replicated reality so well that the user would not be able to differentiate from actual reality. This included the user being able to interact with objects. This concept featured computer hardware to form the virtual world and to keep it functioning in real-time. His paper is seen as the fundamental blueprint for VR.<br>
            
            “The ultimate display would, of course, be a room within which the computer can control the existence of matter. A chair displayed in such a room would be good enough to sit in. Handcuffs displayed in such a room would be confining, and a bullet displayed in such a room would be fatal. With appropriate programming such a display could literally be the Wonderland into which Alice walked.”<br>
            
            <h3>1966</h3><br>
            Thomas Furness, a military engineer, created the first flight simulator for the Air Force. This assisted in the progression of VR because the military subsequently provided a lot of funding for producing better flight simulators.<br>
            
            <h3>1968</h3><br>
            Sutherland, with his student Bob Sproull, created the first virtual reality HMD, named The Sword of Damocles. This head-mount connected to a computer rather than a camera and was quite primitive as it could only show simple virtual wire-frame shapes.<br>
            
            These 3D models changed perspective when the user moved their head due to the tracking system. It was never developed beyond a lab project because it was too heavy for users to comfortably wear; they had to be strapped in because it was suspended from the ceiling.<br>

            <h3>1969</h3><br>
            Myron Krueger, a computer artist, developed a succession of “artificial reality” experiences using computers and video systems. He created computer-generated environments that responded to the people in it. These projects led to VIDEOPLACE technology which is mentioned later.<br>
            
            <h3>1972</h3><br>
            General Electric Corporation built a computerised flight simulator which featured a 180-degree field of vision by using three screens surrounding the cockpit.<br>
            
            <h3>1975</h3><br>
            Krueger’s VIDEOPLACE, the first interactive VR platform, was displayed at the Milwaukee Art Center. It used computer graphics, projectors, video cameras, video displays and position-sensing technology and it didn’t use goggles or gloves. VIDEOPLACE consisted of dark rooms with large video screens to surround the user in “VR”.<br>
            
            VIDEOPLACE VR platform <br>
            The users could see their computer-generated silhouettes imitating their own movements and actions – the users’ movements were recorded on camera and transferred onto the silhouette. Also, users in different rooms could interact with other users’ silhouettes in the same virtual world. This encouraged the idea that people could communicate within a virtual world even if they weren’t physically close.<br>
            
            <h3>1977</h3><br>
            Aspen Movie Map was created by MIT. This program enabled users to virtually wander through Aspen city in Colorado, like with Google Street View. There were three modes: summer, winter and polygons.<br>
            
            It was created using photographs from a car driving through the city. There were no HMDs but it was the use of first-person interactivity and it suggested that VR could transport people to other places.<br>
            
            <h3>1979</h3><br>
            McDonnell-Douglas Corporation integrated VR into its HMD, the VITAL helmet, for military use. A head tracker in the HMD followed the pilot’s eye movements to match computer-generated images.<br>

            <h3>1980</h3><br>
            StereoGraphics company created stereo vision glasses.<br>
            
            <h3>1982</h3><br>
            Sayre gloves were created by Sandin and Defanti. These gloves were the first wired gloves. They monitored hand movements by using light emitters and photocells in the gloves’ fingers. So, when the user moved their fingers the amount of light hitting the photocell varied which then converted the finger movements into electrical signals. This may have been the beginning of gesture recognition.<br>
            
            Furness created a working model of a virtual flight simulator, for the military, called the Visually Coupled Airborne Systems Simulator (VCASS).<br>
            
            <h3>1985</h3><br>
            Jaron Lanier and Thomas Zimmerman founded VPL Research, Inc. This company is known as the first company to sell VR goggles and gloves. They developed a range of VR equipment, such as, the DataGlove, EyePhone HMD and the Audio Sphere.<br>

            <h3>1986</h3><br>
            Furness developed a flight simulator between 1986-1989 known as the Super Cockpit. The training cockpit featured: computer-generated 3D maps, advanced infrared and radar imagery and the pilot could see and hear in real-time.<br>
            
            The helmet’s tracking system and sensors allowed the pilot to control the aircraft using gestures, speech and eye movements. Read more about Thomas Furness.<br>
            
            <h3>1987</h3><br>
            British Aerospace used the HMD similarly to Furness’ Super Cockpit and developed the Virtual Cockpit which also featured speech recognition.<br>
            
            Jaron Lanier popularised the term “Virtual Reality” while at VPL Research. The VR and graphics-related patents were later bought by Sun Microsystems.<br>
            
            The company Dimension International created a software that could build 3D worlds in a PC.<br>
            
            <h3>1989</h3><br>
            Scott Foster founded Crystal River Engineering Inc after receiving a contract from NASA to develop the audio element of the Virtual Environment Workstation Project (VIEW) – a VR training simulator for astronauts. Through this company real-time binaural 3D audio processing was developed.<br>

            Mattel, Inc released the Power Glove, based on VPL’s DataGlove. The Power Glove was a controller accessory for the Nintendo Entertainment System, but it never took off as it was difficult to use.<br>
            
            <h3>1990</h3><br>
            Jonathan Waldern exhibited Virtuality, a VR arcade machine, at the Computer Graphics 90 exhibition in London.<br>
            
            <h3>1991</h3><br>
            Antonio Medina, a NASA scientist, designed a VR system to drive the Mars robot rovers from Earth in supposed real-time despite signal delays between the planets. This system is called “Computer Simulated Teleoperation”.<br>
            
            The Virtuality Group launched Virtuality. These were VR arcade machines where gamers could play in a 3D gaming world. This was the first mass-produced VR entertainment system.<br>
            
            A Virtuality pod featured VR headsets and real-time immersive stereoscopic 3D images. Some of the machines could be networked together for multi-player games. Eventually some of the very popular arcade games, like Pac-Man, had VR versions.<br>
            
           <h4> Virtuality VR arcade machine</h4><br>
            SEGA announced that they were working on the SEGA VR headset which would be available for the general public to purchase. This headset was meant to be used for arcade games and the Mega Drive console. It had a visor-like look due to the influence of popular films, such as, RoboCop. LCD displays were placed in the visor, as well as stereo headphones and sensors for tracking head movement.
            
            However, it was never released even though four games were made for it. One of the explanations for the termination was SEGA’s concern of people injuring themselves as the VR effect was too realistic. However, this seems unlikely due to the limited processing power.
            
            <h3>1994</h3><br>
            SEGA released SEGA VR-1, a motion simulator arcade machine.<br>
            
            VictorMaxx released a VR headset called CyberMaxx.<br>
            
            <h3>1995</h3><br>
            <b>Nintendo launched the Virtual Boy console which played 3D monochrome video games. It was the first portable console to display 3D graphics. But it was a commercial failure due to:<br> </b>

            <h2>VR in Gaming</h2>
            <p>VR gaming has transformed the gaming industry by offering an immersive experience that puts players inside the game world. Popular VR games include Beat Saber, Half-Life: Alyx, and The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim VR<br>
            <br>    
            What is virtual reality gaming (VR gaming)?<br>
            Virtual reality gaming is the application of a three-dimensional (3D) artificial environment to computer games. Virtual reality environments are created with VR software and presented to the user in such a way that they supersede the real-world environment, creating suspension of disbelief and helping the user experience the VR environment as real.<br><br>
            
            Users can play VR games on smartphones, PCs and laptops, and gaming consoles. VR gaming control may involve a standard keyboard and mouse, game controllers and motion capture methods. More complex VR rooms may include treadmill floors or similar methods to further the user's sense of freedom of movement and feelings of immersion within the virtual environment. In other VR gaming setups, the user may be confined to a limited area surrounding a computer but have free range of motion within the area.<br>
            <br>
            As advancements were made in the technology, VR hardware for gaming has matured to the point that VR headsets offer gaming experiences with little lag or nausea, two areas that had presented problems historically. Some experts believe that people can build a tolerance to VR induced nausea as well.<br> 
            
            <h4>Some VR headsets on the market are the following:</h4>
            
            HP Reverb<br>
            Meta Quest<br>
            Microsoft Hololens<br>
            Samsung Gear VR<br>
            Sony PlayStation<br>
            Valve Index<br>
            Most of these companies offer motion controllers and a tracker to work in concert with the headset. In addition to entertainment, VR games can be used for various types of training and for virtual reality therapy.<br>
            <br>
            VR gaming is distinct from augmented reality gaming (AR gaming), which involves the integration of digital content with the user's real-world environment.<br>
            <br>
            
            How does VR gaming work?<br>
            VR gaming systems are composed of a game and hardware. The games are designed to create an immersive experience that gives users the feeling that they are interacting with a world outside their physical bodies. These systems are designed to have as little latency as possible to give fast and accurate feedback to users based on their actions.<br>
            <br>
            VR gaming systems generate realistic sensations that simulate users' physical presence in a computer-generated environment. The goal of VR gaming systems is to let users believe they inhabit a virtual world. People using VR gaming systems move around the virtual world and interact with virtual features and items.<br>
            <br>
            At its simplest, a VR game is a 3D image that can be explored interactively on a computing device by manipulating keys, mouse or touchscreen. More commonly, virtual reality uses a head-mounted display with a screen that wraps around the eyes. These systems also use specially designed rooms with multiple projectors and large screens.<br>
            <br>
            VR rooms may be enhanced with wearable technology and sensory components, such as scents and Haptic devices for tactile feedback.<br>

            Types of VR gaming accessories and hardware<br>
            The headsets and controllers that make up VR gaming systems are often sold together.<br>
            <br>

            Today's VR headset technology has eliminated issues with lag and nausea.<br>
            Headsets<br>
            Virtual reality headsets are used to immerse the user in a game or work setting. Some headsets can capture head and eye movements and transmit them to the game. Others include stereo sound systems to project the game's audio content. Some come just as goggles that display the virtual game world to the user. VR headsets do not let users see any of the real external world around them. Some headsets also come with built-in microphones.<br>
            <br>
            Controllers
            These hand-based controllers let users interact with the virtual world. Users can select objects, drag and drop objects, point, outline boundaries and scroll up or down with a VR controller. Some controllers have motion detectors that can sense a user's hand motion, like throwing, for example. The controller recreates these actions in the game.<br>
            <br>
            VR gloves take VR controllers a step further by detecting micromovements in the user's hands and fingers and transmitting those to the game. This adds small motor skills to VR video games and enables users to grasp, pick up and carry small items in a game. Some gloves contain haptic technology that let users feel the virtual world of the game. The gloves create vibrations on the fingertips to simulate the presence of an object. Some also contain tiny actuators that displace the user's skin and apply significant resistive force.<br>
            <br>
            <h4>Some other auxiliary VR gaming accessories are the following:</h4>
            steering wheels and accelerator controllers for racing games;<br>
            treadmills that sense running distance and speed;<br>
            full-body haptic suits;<br>
            gun stocks that simulate a real gun in a virtual environment;<br>
            table tennis paddle grips;<br>
            haptic foot controllers and shoes;<br>
            base stations that locate and track wireless VR objects and incorporate them into a game;<br>
            cloth covers for increased headset comfort; and<br>
            portable battery packs to power more complex VR technology.<br>
            What to consider when buying VR gaming equipment<br>
            <h4>There are a number of factors to consider when buying VR gaming equipment:</h4>
            
           <b>Budget.</b> VR equipment ranges in price with many options costing hundreds of dollars.<br>
            Platform. The options available are standalone systems that don't require an external system or PC-, smartphone- or console-based VR systems. Current smartphone VR sets are less immersive than PC or console ones.<br>
            Compatibility. If using a PC-based VR system, users must make sure the computer meets gaming system's qualifications in areas such as graphics cards and processing power.<br>
            Resolution. It's important to have a high-resolution headset to have a realistic VR experience. Resolution per eye is the metric used to measure headset resolution. It denotes the number of pixels the headset can display.<br>
            Field of view. This metric describes how much of the virtual environment is visible to the viewer at any one time. A higher field of view creates a more immersive experience.<br>
            Refresh rate. This is measured in frames per second (FPS) and dictates the smoothness of an image. A low FPS rate can cause motion sickness.<br>
            Tracking. Positional tracking aligns a user's physical movement with in-game movement. Virtual reality systems that provide one-to-one positional tracking avoid in-game delays.<br>
            Physical space. VR gaming usually requires the user to move around in physical space to act out actions in the virtual world. Users must ensure they have a suitable space to play virtual games so as not to injure themselves.<br>
            Physical conditions. Although technology is improving, VR systems have the potential to induce nausea. Some also warn people with epilepsy against using them.<br>
           <br> <b>History of VR gaming</b><br>
            VR gaming was a logical extension of video games and 3D games. Prior to the development of compact VR technology, VR gaming used projector rooms with multiple screens and projectors.<br>
            
           <h4> Significant VR gaming milestones include the following:</h4>
           
            <b>1962. </b>Cinematographer Morton Heilig created what is often recognized as the first virtual reality machine. Sensorama was a booth that multiple people could sit in for a fully immersed movie experience. It included audio, 3D video, vibrations and smell. Heilig was granted the patent for it in 1962.<br> <br>
            <b>1965.</b> Computer scientist Ivan Sutherland described his vision of the Ultimate Display in a paper. It was a room in which a computer controlled the existence of matter, using interactive graphics and force-feedback controller capabilities.<br> <br>
            <b>1968. </b>Sutherland created a head-mounted device, called the Sword of Damocles, that presented 3D models to the wearer. The models changed their perspective when the user moved their head.<br> <br>
            <b>1984.</b> Computer scientist Jaron Lanier popularized the term virtual reality in the 1980s and described how VR could make television and video games more engaging. Lanier founded VPL in 1984, which became the first company to sell virtual reality technology. VPL's DataGlove let people move and reorient virtual objects.<br> <br>
            <b>1989.</b> The DataGlove inspired engineers at Mattel and Nintendo to create a consumer-grade version at a much lower price. Power Glove for the Nintendo Entertainment System came out in 1989, along with two games designed for the VR device: Super Glove Ball and Bad Street Brawler.<br> <br>
            <b>1995.</b> Nintendo released the Virtual Boy gaming console, which used a VR headset to display stereoscopic 3D graphics. However, the technology was considered a commercial failure because of the complexity and cost of creating consumer-grade VR gaming industry products.<br> <br>
            <b>2010.</b> Palmer Luckey developed the prototype of the Oculus Rift headset, which was released as a commercial product in 2016. Oculus Rift was marketed to gamers as an inexpensive option for VR video games and led to the development of PlayStation VR and the HTC Vive later that year.<br> <br>
            <b>2019.</b> Oculus Quest, a division of Facebook -- now called Meta -- developed the Oculus Quest headset. Facebook also invested in Reality Labs and its work developing the metaverse.<br> <br>
            <b>2021.</b> The concept of the metaverse became popular as Meta developed ways for users to socialize and play games in its metaverse. Interest in the metaverse started driving investment in VR technology for corporate use.<br>
            Graphic showing how augmented reality and virtual reality differThe key way that augmented reality and virtual reality differ<br>
            <br>Virtual reality vs. augmented reality vs. mixed reality<br><br>
            Virtual reality and augmented reality have some significant overlap, but there are key differences between the two concepts. Like virtual reality, augmented reality can be used in gaming and a variety of other contexts.<br>
            <br>
            
            Virtual reality creates a completely simulated environment that a user perceives as approximating reality through their senses. The user suspends belief and accepts that the VR is real. The entire environment is simulated.<br>
            <br>
            By contrast, AR integrates virtual elements into a real environment. The user is not transported to another place. Instead, digital technology augments or changes the place they are in.<br>
            <br>
            A simple example of augmented reality would be a game of virtual checkers projected on a table surface. One real-world example of augmented reality gaming is the mobile application Pokemon Go. <br>
            The game uses a smartphone's gyroscope, camera, clock and GPS to create a location-based AR environment. Users point their smartphone camera at the current environment, where a virtual Pokemon is superimposed on the picture of the real environment.<br>
            <br>
            
            Chart comparing augmented reality, virtual reality and mixed realityThree different simulation types are used in gaming and business.<br>
            Mixed reality is similar to augmented reality but further blends the digital and physical worlds so that there is more digital content than with augmented reality. Mixed reality is sometimes referred to as hybrid reality.<br>
            
            Virtual reality enables the metaverse, which shows promise for businesses, gamers and casual users alike. Take a look at 12 metaverse predictions.</p>

            <br>
            
            VR allows students to experience destinations from across the world without ever having to leave the classroom. Imagine students being able to explore the pyramids of giza whilst sat at their desks. This is what virtual reality education allows.<br>
            
            
            <b>VR in the classroom</b>
            Most people have heard of virtual reality (VR) but many people do not know what it is or how it is used in learning and education.<br>
            <br>
            
            VR refers to interactive content (images or videos) which enables the viewer to explore the entire 360 degrees of a scene.<br>
            <br>
            
            Take a look at a short VR video of Roche Abbey in Yorkshire, below. You can click or drag across the video to view the entire scene.<br>
            <br>
            
            
            VR video of Roche Abbey filmed by Immersion VR<br>
            How does it work?<br>
            A type of VR known as 360VR is most commonly used in education. With this type of VR, real-world locations are captured with specialist cameras and equipment. The footage is then taken back to the studio where it is produced into VR content.<br>
            <br>
            
            
            Specialist camera being used by Immersion VR<br>
            The VR content can then be viewed on VR headsets or projected onto walls in what are known as immersive classrooms.<br>
            <br>            
            360VR can be used in education to teach pupils about the world around them. What’s more, virtual reality has a unique ability to inspire and engage students.<br>
            <br>
            Students can experience locations that would not be possible or too expensive to visit in person. In this way, VR can open a whole new world of possibilities to teachers and schools.<br>
            <br>
            How can virtual reality improve education?<br>
            Virtual reality can improve education by providing students with memorable and immersive experiences that would otherwise not be possible. What’s more, it can all take place within the classroom.<br>
            <br>
            VR is accessible to every student and can be easily monitored by teachers. Virtual experiences have the power to engage and inspire students in a unique and powerful way.<br>
            
            <br>
            Given the growth of VR within education, and the positive response from schools, we wouldn’t be surprised if VR made it onto the curriculum at some point in the future. Curriculum aligned content and structured VR lesson plans have already been developed and are available in the UK.<br>
            
            How can virtual reality help students?<br>
            <h4>There are so many ways in which virtual reality can help students but the main points are below:</h4><br>
            
            1. Students learn better through experience<br>
            VR provides students an opportunity to learn through experience, in contrast to the traditional methods of reading and writing.<br>
            <br>
            2. VR has the ability to inspire<br>
            Being able to see and experience extraordinary locations within the classroom is completely unique to VR and it is inspirational to students.<br>
            <br>
            3. VR sparks the imagination and encourages creative thinking<br>
            The immersive experience that VR provides is unparalleled in teaching. Students are “transported” out of the classroom and their imagination is allowed to flourish.<br>
            <br>
            4. VR in education promotes peer interaction<br>
            Throughout the VR experience, students are encouraged to interact with each other. Afterwards, they are eager to share their thoughts and discuss their experiences.<br>
            <br>
            5. VR engages students<br>
            Many students get bored with classic teaching methods. The modern technology of VR gets students’ attention like nothing else. We find that students instantly want to try out the VR.<br>
            <br>
            6. VR provides realistic travel experiences<br>
            Using VR, schools can provide students with travel experiences that would not be possible or practical. Schools can save time and money whilst providing students with incredible experiences.<br>
            <br>
            7. VR in the classroom is inclusive<br>
            With VR, every student gets the same opportunity to enjoy the experience. Unlike traditional school trips that can be too expensive for parents or too impractical for their children, VR is for all students.<br>
            <br>
            8. VR offers memorable educational experiences<br>
            Long after the VR has finished, students remember the experience and they are eager to reflect on it in future lessons.<br>

            Implementing VR in the classroom<br>
            There are two main ways in which VR is implemented in the classroom: VR headsets, and immersive classrooms.<br>
            <br>
            What is an immersive classroom?<br>
            One of the most common and effective ways of utilising VR in education is via virtual reality classrooms, or immersive classrooms.<br>
            <br>
            An immersive classroom is a teaching room in which images are projected onto the internal walls of the room. This creates a virtual environment within the classroom.<br>
            <br>
            
            An Immersive Classroom<br> 
            Students can be “transported” to a different place, without having to leave the classroom. Without the need for VR headsets, students can enjoy the experience together, and are encouraged to interact with each other.<br>
            <br>
            Unlike VR headsets which some students can find difficult or uncomfortable to use, immersive classrooms are suitable for all students. The pupils are able to enjoy the VR content in a more familiar environment.<br>
            <br>
            VR headsets in the classroom<br>
            VR headsets are a common, practical way of implementing VR in the classroom. With minimal cost, equipment, and space needed, an increasing number of schools are turning to VR headsets.<br>
            <br>
            For a classroom of 30 students, typically up to 15 headsets are required. These are usually standalone headsets, which means they don’t have to be connected to any other device, such as a computer.<br>
            <br>
            Teachers are taught how to use the headsets before implementing them into a lesson.<br>
            <br>
            The main benefit of VR headsets is the level of immersion they provide. Although they can be a little more tricky to use than immersive classrooms, they provide an incredibly realistic experience. An experience that students aren’t likely to forget in a hurry.<br>
            <br>
            VR in primary schools<br>
            VR can be effectively used in primary education, and is becoming increasingly common in the UK.<br>
            <br>
            Immersive classrooms tend to be more popular than VR headsets amongst primary schools. This is because every student can be easily monitored, and young students do not need to be shown how to use headsets. This ensures that the experience is smoother and equal for all the students.<br>
            <br>
            Pupils are asked to look around and talk about what they see. This provides opportunities for students to collaborate and can particularly improve interaction amongst more introverted students.<br>
            <br>
            Reducing social barriers at a young age is extremely important and is one of the reasons many primary schools are turning to VR.<br>
            <br>
            Virtual reality in secondary education<br>
            Within secondary education, VR headsets tend to be more popular than immersive classrooms. This is because the impact on older students tends to be greater with the headsets.<br>
            <br>
            
            With the entire field of view enclosed, the sense of immersion with a VR headset is unparalleled. Also, unlike with primary school pupils, secondary students are better able to use the headsets, requiring less input and guidance from the teacher.<br>
            <br>
            By utilising VR headsets, teachers are able to provide secondary students with a feeling of actually “being there” – this is what we mean when we talk about immersion. For many students this is an incredible experience, and it is something that really has to be tried before it can be judged.</p>

            <h2>VR in Healthcare</h2>
            <p>In healthcare, VR is used for simulation training, therapeutic purposes, and patient rehabilitation, offering innovative ways to treat and manage various health conditionsScienceSoft Global Menu iconBack to the main menu<br>
                <br>
                
                <br>
                Virtual Reality solutions allow both healthcare professionals and patients interact with simulated environments tailored for medical education (including simulative surgery training), pain management or rehabilitation. In 2022, the global healthcare VR market was estimated $628 million. It is projected to grow at an average CAGR of 38.7% and reach $6.2 billion by 2029.<br>
            
            <b>VR Adoption in Healthcare:</b<br>
            According to the Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research, healthcare is among the top 3 industries that will remain leading adopters of VR technology up to 2025.<br>
            <br>
            
            82% of healthcare professionals agree that virtual reality creates a convenient way of accessing and learning information for medical students and practicing healthcare professionals, Accenture says. The agency also reports that 62% of patients would welcome virtual reality healthcare services as an alternative to traditional healthcare.<br>
            <br>
            
            <b>The key drivers of the growing VR adoption in healthcare are:</b><br>
            
            
            Extreme demand for quality healthcare services.<br>
            Need to reduce healthcare costs.<br>
            Increased role of connected devices in the healthcare sector.<br>
            <br>VR Software Architecture<br>
            The architecture of VR applications in healthcare depends on their use in the industry. However, the general architecture always includes 3 main components: a client VR application (with a VR visualization module), a database (with 3D models, scenarios, and users), and a web administration panel that grants access to and control of both the app and the database.<br>
            
            Thypical architecture of VR applications in healthcare- ScienceSoft<br>
            
          <br> <b>Application of VR in Healthcare:<br></b>
            
            Virtual reality makes for more effective theoretical learning of medical students and starting-out healthcare professionals. With VR, learners can inspect 3D medical models in the details, which can’t be reproduced in physical models, or learn to communicate with AI-controlled virtual patients, whose attitude and behavior can be easily altered for different learning purposes (e.g., communication with patients who are non-native English speakers).<br>
            
            How VR for medical education works: Any virtual learning session can be held in groups or individually and guided either by a real tutor, who is also connected to the VR app or by a virtual preprogrammed tutor controlled by the AI algorithms.<br>
            <br>
            
            Use cases:<br>
                            
            Anatomy learning.<br>
            Medical social skills learning.<br>
            <br>
            VR for  Medical learning:<br>
            
            VR software that focuses specifically on practical medical training helps medical school graduates and healthcare professionals alike acquire hands-on skills in risk-free conditions. This type of healthcare VR allows simulating scenarios that are difficult, dangerous, or expensive to recreate in real life.<br>
            <br>
            How VR for medical training works: Upon entering a VR app’s simulated environment, a user becomes a part of a training scenario that expects them to complete predetermined steps in, for instance, performing a medical procedure or handling medical equipment. A separate analytical module continuously records the taken actions and assesses a medical professional’s performance based on set criteria.<br>
            
            <br>Use cases:<br>
            
            Medical procedure simulation.<br>
            Emergency case simulation.<br>
            Medical equipment use training.<br>
            <br>
            VR for suegery:<br>
            
            By allowing surgeons to perform different types of mock-surgeries in the virtual space, VR helps eliminate practical skill deficiency faster. Surgeons can become skilled professionals without using expensive onetime use mannequins for training. <br>
            <br>
            How VR for surgery works: With the help of haptic controllers, a surgeon performs a virtual surgery in a virtual operating room. From start to finish, software guides a user through the necessary steps, letting them remember the right sequence of actions. The VR app can also be used for explaining the surgery process to patients.
            
            <br>
           <br> Use case: <br>
            
            Surgical training.<br>
            Pre-surgical planning.<br>
            Medical device marketing.<br>
            <br>
            Virtual reality pain management apps help lower the level of pain or extreme discomfort by effectively diverting a patient’s attention. This type of VR helps minimize the use of potentially harming painkillers and reduce healthcare costs.<br>
            <br>
            How VR for pain management works: After being immersed in the VR simulation, a patient can either become a part of an interactive gamified experience or transferred to a highly realistic environment with a soothing atmosphere that, together with audio stimulation, helps put their mind at ease.<br>
            <br>
            Use cases:<br>
            <br>
            Chronic pains.<br>
            Acute pains.<br>
            Medical procedure pain.<br>
            Mental pain and anxiety.<br>

            VR for Rehabilitation<br>
            <br>
            By moving rehabilitation exercises into the virtual realm, VR turns patients’ therapy sessions into a gamified experience that motivates users to strive for better results via virtual goals and achievements. Software’s built-in AI can provide detailed guidance and inspiring support instead of a real therapist, allowing for cheaper and timewise flexible individual rehabilitation.<br>
            <br>
            How VR for rehabilitation works: The VR app guides a patient through their personal training program stored in the software database. A therapist can edit the program anytime as well as control the results – either via the app’s analytics module or by virtually joining the VR session as an instructor.<br>
            <br>
            Use cases:<br>
            <br>
            Neurological rehabilitation.<br>

            VR for Physical Therapy<br>
            <br>
            Virtual physical therapy can offer patients a wide range of exercises – from general orthopedics to injury-recovery. The exercises can be created for specific age-groups too, thus helping children to develop motor skills and older patients – to preserve their agility. Special sessions can also be created for people, who are learning to use a cane or a prosthetic limb.<br>
            <br>
            How VR for physical therapy works: All exercises can be supervised by either an AI-based virtual instructor or a real instructor, who joins the VR sessions remotely. A comprehensive analytics system continuously monitors a patient’s condition and ensures that the exercises do not harm a patient's health in any way.<br>
            <br>
            Use cases:<br>
            <br>
            Sports injuries.<br>

            VR for Stroke Rehabilitation<br>
            <br>
            VR for Stroke Rehabilitation<br>
            <br>
            To effectively recover after stroke, patients re-learn to perform their typical daily actions in the virtual environment. Patients can access a rich database of exercises that help them restore motor skills or improve spatial orientation abilities without posing any risks of damage to self, others or the objects they manipulate. The rehabilitation can be remote, thus allowing to significantly minimize the costs of treatment and transportation.<br>
            <br>
            How VR for stroke rehabilitation works: While post-stroke patients perform repetitive exercises in the VR world, the integrated machine-learning algorithms continuously monitor their performance and automatically adjust the difficulty to ensure progress. Therapists can access the admin panel to check how far their patients progressed or what exercises they got stuck on.<br>
            <br>
            Use cases:<br>
            <br>
            Physical function restoration.<br>
            Cognitive abilities improvement.</p>
